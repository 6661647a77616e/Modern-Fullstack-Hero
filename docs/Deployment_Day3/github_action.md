## What are GitHub Actions?

<p style="font-size: 20px;">GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool integrated into GitHub that allows developers to automate workflows for their projects. With GitHub Actions, you can define custom workflows to build, test, package, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository. This CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) service enables developers to streamline their development process and improve collaboration within teams.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Workflows in GitHub Actions are defined using YAML files, which specify the events that trigger the workflows, the jobs to be executed, and the steps to be carried out within each job. This makes it easy to automate repetitive tasks and maintain code quality by integrating automated tests into the development cycle.</p>

## How to Use GitHub Actions with Digital Ocean

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Integrating GitHub Actions with Digital Ocean allows you to automate the deployment of your applications to Digital Ocean's infrastructure seamlessly. Hereâ€™s how you can set up a basic workflow to deploy your application to a Digital Ocean Droplet:</p>

### Step 1: Create a Digital Ocean Droplet

<p style="font-size: 20px;">First, you'll need to create a Droplet on Digital Ocean where your application will be deployed. Choose the appropriate operating system and configuration that fits your project needs.</p>

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Secrets

<p style="font-size: 20px;">In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add the following secrets:</p>

- `DO_API_TOKEN`: Your Digital Ocean API token.
- `DO_SERVER_IP`: The IP address of your Digital Ocean Droplet.
- `DO_USER`: The username to connect to your Droplet (usually `root`).

### Step 3: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:</p>

```yaml
name: Deploy to Digital Ocean

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build the application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Digital Ocean
        env:
          DO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DO_API_TOKEN }}
          DO_SERVER_IP: ${{ secrets.DO_SERVER_IP }}
          DO_USER: ${{ secrets.DO_USER }}
        run: |
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $DO_USER@$DO_SERVER_IP "mkdir -p ~/app && rm -rf ~/app/*"
          scp -r ./* $DO_USER@$DO_SERVER_IP:~/app
          ssh $DO_USER@$DO_SERVER_IP "cd ~/app && npm install --production && pm2 restart app"
```
### Step 4: Push Changes and Deploy

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Once you've created the workflow file, push your changes to the <code>main</code> branch of your repository. This action will trigger the workflow automatically, and your application will be deployed to your Digital Ocean Droplet whenever you push changes to the main branch.</p>

### Step 5: Monitor Your Deployment

<p style="font-size: 20px;">After pushing your changes, you can monitor the status of your GitHub Actions workflow in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository. Here, you can view logs for each step of the workflow, helping you troubleshoot any issues that may arise during deployment.</p>

### Step 6: Verify Your Application

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Once the deployment is successful, you can verify that your application is running correctly by visiting the IP address of your Digital Ocean Droplet in a web browser. Ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.</p>

## Conclusion

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Using GitHub Actions to automate your deployment process to Digital Ocean streamlines your workflow, enhances productivity, and minimizes the chances of human error during the deployment phase. This integration allows developers to focus more on writing code and less on the deployment process, making it an invaluable tool for modern software development.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">With the steps outlined above, you can successfully deploy your applications using GitHub Actions and Digital Ocean, creating a robust CI/CD pipeline that supports continuous development and delivery.</p>
